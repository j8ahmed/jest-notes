# Jest Testing Library Notes

Hi there, 

I've been self-learning Jest for a few weeks now. I've read through a reasonable portion of the docs, watched some YouTube videos and tested out some of it's features in my own personal projects.

Personally, outside of the main testing suite / matcher API docs there is not that much simplified information about Jest out there. The examples I have seen have been somewhat shallow in blog posts etc... As a result, I have been writing my own notes on the subject for a while but not as a Git Repo. I figure, since I'm writing my own detailed notes anyways, I might as well potentially helps others who might benefit from them being public. It's my first time doing something like this so bare with me. 

Any feedback, error corrections, etc... is greatly appreciated. 

Cheers,
<br/>

P.S. I am clearly not comfortable writing README files yet... lol
